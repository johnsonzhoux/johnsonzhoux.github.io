# 👋 Hi, I'm Zhou

I’m a **3D scanning & computer vision engineer** focused on building **industrial-grade 3D scanning systems**, **Qt C++ desktop applications**, and **image/point cloud algorithms**.

I help companies turn **hardware + algorithms** into real **products**: from cameras & projectors to reconstruction, analysis, and user-friendly software.

  - Projector-as-inverse-camera calibration

- 🖥 **Qt C++ desktop software**
  - Industrial 3D scanning UI
  - Device control panels (cameras, motors, lights, projectors)
  - Real-time preview, capture, reconstruction workflows

- 📸 **Computer vision & image processing (OpenCV)**
  - Calibration (camera, projector)
  - Image enhancement, segmentation
  - Skin analysis (spots, pores, wrinkles, redness, texture)

- 🌐 **3D point cloud & mesh processing (PCL / custom)**
  - Point cloud fusion & denoising
  - Poisson reconstruction
  - Alignment, filtering, smoothing
  - 3D visualization (Qt3D)

- 📦 **SDK / library development**

### 2️⃣ Skin Analysis & Medical Aesthetics Algorithms

I work on **high-resolution facial & skin image analysis**, including:

- Brown spots, UV spots, red area detection
- Pore & wrinkle analysis
- Texture enhancement & feature extraction
- 2D + 3D combined skin visualization
- Batch processing of large image sets

**What I can do for you:**

> Develop image analysis SDKs or desktop tools for skin clinics, beauty devices, or medical aesthetics platforms.

### 3️⃣ Qt C++ Industrial Applications

I have extensive experience building **Qt-based applications** that control:

- Cameras (SDK integration, capture, parameter control)
- Projectors / MEMS / structured-light engines
- Stepper motors, serial devices, lighting modules
- Complex workflows implemented via state machines

**What I can do for you:**

> Deliver a complete Qt application (or core modules) for your device, from low-level control to operator UI.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks**

- C++ (modern C++), Qt (Widgets, Qt3D)
- Python (for tools / prototypes)
- CMake, Visual Studio, MSVC

**Computer Vision & 3D**

- OpenCV (image processing, calibration)
- PCL (Point Cloud Library)
- Custom multi-frequency phase-unwrapping
- Structured-light reconstruction math

**Hardware & Devices**

- Industrial cameras
- Projectors / MEMS modules
- Motor control, serial communication (UART)
- USB devices & custom protocols

## 🧪 How I Work

- 🔍 **Understand your problem**: hardware, constraints, target accuracy, budget
- 🧠 **Design architecture**: from optics & acquisition to algorithms & UI
- 🛠 **Implement core algorithms**: robust, measured, with logs and tests
- 🧪 **Validate & optimize**: speed, stability, accuracy
- 📦 **Deliver usable tools**: SDK, demo app, or full application

I’m especially good at:

> Taking a messy prototype (scripts, test code, ad-hoc logic)  
> and turning it into a **clean, documented, product-ready module or app**.

## 🌍 Collaboration

I’m open to:

- Remote **consulting** on 3D scanning / vision systems
- **Algorithm & SDK development** (C++ / Qt / OpenCV / PCL)
- **Long-term technical partnership** for 3D / imaging products

If your team needs help in **3D reconstruction, structured light, or imaging software**, feel free to reach out.
