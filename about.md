title: "About Me | 3D Vision & Scanning Engineer"
---

# 👋 About Me

I’m **Zhou**, a computer vision & 3D scanning engineer specializing in **structured-light systems**, **Qt desktop applications**, and **high-performance C++ image/3D algorithms**.

Over the past years, I have built full-stack 3D vision systems, integrating:

- 📷 **Industrial cameras**
- 🔦 **Projectors / MEMS modules**
- ⚙️ **Motorized scanning platforms**
- 🧠 **Phase decoding & reconstruction algorithms**
- 🖥️ **Qt software for operation & visualization**
- 📦 **SDKs for commercial products**

## 🔧 My Engineering Philosophy

I believe that real engineering happens when:

- Hardware, software, and algorithms work **seamlessly together**
- The system is **stable**, **repeatable**, and usable by non-engineers
- Every module—from UI to calibration—is **cleanly designed**
- Performance, accuracy, and reliability are all **measurable**

This shapes how I build tools:
> Clear architecture → Reliable core algorithms → Product-ready applications.
